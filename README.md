appending "acpi_backlight=vendor" at the end of the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX setting, E.g., changing:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.lvm.lv=fedora/swap rd.lvm.lv=fedora/root rhgb quiet"
```

to:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.lvm.lv=fedora/swap rd.lvm.lv=fedora/root rhgb quiet acpi_backlight=vendor"
```

### How to move space from a dual boot Windows partition to Fedora and use it to extend Fedora home partition

First, delete existing dual-boot partition:
```
sudo fdisk /dev/sda

# type 'p', which stands for print and browse available partitions

# type 'd', which stands for delete
d

# type the number of partition to be deleted, E.g. 5
5

# write to the disk
w
```

Create a new partition that will be used by Fedora:
```
sudo fdisk /dev/sda

# type 'p', which stands for print and browse available partitions

# type 'n', which stands for new partition creation
n

# select new partition number (E.g. type: 7):
7

# keep pressing enter to create a new partition with size equal to the amount of free space on the disk

# write to the disk
w
```

Reboot the system.

Create a new device on top of the newly created partition:
```
sudo pvcreate /dev/sda7
```

Extend Fedora to use the new device:
```
sudo vgextend fedora /dev/sda7
```

Extend Fedora home to use the new partition:
```
sudo lvextend -L150G /dev/mapper/fedora-home
```

Resize Fedora home to give all the newly added space:
```
sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/fedora-home
```

Confirm that Fedora home has been extended:
```
df -h
```

Sample output:
```
Filesystem               Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/fedora-home  148G   26G  116G  18% /home
```

### Upgrade Fedora to the latest version

First apply updates:
```
sudo dnf -y update
```

Install System Upgrade tool:
```
sudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade
```

Download and install a new version of Fedora:
```
sudo dnf system-upgrade download --refresh --releasever=29
```

Reboot the system:
```
sudo dnf system-upgrade reboot
```
